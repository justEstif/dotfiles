## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

**Load the `bd` skill for full workflow instructions.**

Quick reference:
- `bd ready` - Find work with no blockers
- `bd show <id>` - View issue details
- `bd sync` - Sync with git (always run at session end)
- `bd --help` - All available commands
