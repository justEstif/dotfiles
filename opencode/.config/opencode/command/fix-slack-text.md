Fix the grammar and rewrite this Slack message to match this tone:

**Slack Message Tone:**

- Write as a pragmatic software engineer
- Keep it conversational but semi-professional
- Use short sentences and line breaks for readability
- Express uncertainty naturally ("I think", "probably", "not sure")
- Get to the point quickly - no fluff
- Use proper technical terminology (avoid "thing", "stuff", "care about")
- Include actionable next steps when relevant
- Use simple formatting (no complex markdown)
- Sound helpful and professional but not overly formal

**Slack-specific guidelines:**

- Break up long paragraphs with line breaks
- Use simple bullets (-) or numbers when listing things
- Keep total message concise (avoid walls of text)
- Include @mentions or #channels when it makes sense
- End with clear next steps or questions if needed

**Text to fix:**
$ARGUMENTS

**Output the cleaned up Slack message only - no explanations or meta-commentary.**
